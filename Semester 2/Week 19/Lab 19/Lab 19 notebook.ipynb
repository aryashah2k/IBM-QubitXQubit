    "\n",
    "**What is key distribution?** Secure communication relies on the ability of the sender (Alice) to encrypt the message in a way that the receiver (Bob) can decrypt it but not an eavesdropper. This security is often accomplished with the use of a **key**, which is a piece of information known only to the sender and receiver and enables them to decrypt and encrypt the message. If a key can be securely distributed between the sender and receiver, the encrypted message can be securely sent over a public channel, since without the key, the probability of successfully decrypting the message is tiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, **a key is just a bitstring** - a sequence of 1s and 0s, that is uniquely known only to Alice and Bob, the two communicating parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the problem of secure communication boils down to secure key distribution. QKD is unique because security against eavesdropping is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics, as opposed to the computational complexity of certain functions, which is what is used in classical key distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will develop qiskit code to implement Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). We will look at the same BB84 protocol that was discussed in lecture this week. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also continue making the conceptual leap we started last week - instead of directly defining circuits, we will create functions that define the circuits for us. **We're learning how to move up the quantum stack!**"

    "## 1.1 Quantum Key Distribution Activity layout\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, and in your homework, we are going to implement the BB84 protocol. Remember from lecture the following steps of the protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `SELECT ENCODING`: Alice randomly selects a basis ( × or + ) to encode each bit.\n",
    "2. `SELECT MEASUREMENT`: Bob randomly selects a basis ( × or + ) to measure each bit.\n",
    "3. `ENCODE`: Alice creates the quantum states, encoded in the selected bases.\n",
    "4. `SEND`: Alice sends Bob the encoded states, via the quantum channel. \n",
    "5. `MEASURE`: Bob measures all the quantum states in his pre-selected measurement bases.\n",
    "6. `ANNOUNCE BASIS`: Alice announces which basis she used to encode each bit, via the classical channel.\n",
    "7. `FIND SYMMETRIC KEY`: Alice and Bob discard bits in their key that used a different encoding and decoding basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 7 steps allow a key to be distributed between Alice and Bob securely, now the two can send secure and encrypted messages through an insecure channel. In the required content for this lab, we will implement steps 1-4, and in the optional content we will implement steps 5-7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have left out **Step8: Analysis** here. In this lab, we will not worry about an eavesdropper, but focus on the code for the basic protocol. Therefore, Alice and Bob don't need to run an analysis step. If you're interested, you can try implementing code for Eve in the optional challenge section at the end of the notebook!"

    "How does encryption and decryption work? Once a key has been distributed between Alice and Bob, Alice uses the key to encrypt the message, and Bob uses the same key to decrypt it. To encrypt the message, Alice uses a **reversible** function, so that Bob can apply the same function to the encrypted message to decrypt it. A commonly used function is XOR - each bit of the message is XOR'd with the corresponding bit of the key to encrypt it, i.e., if the message bit is $b$, the encryted message is $b \\oplus 1$ or $b \\oplus 0$, depending on the corresponding bit of the key. For decryption, the encryted message is XOR'd again with the same bit of the key. This process works because\n",

In this case, Alice and Bob will perform step 8: Analysis. How might this step be implemented? Test out this step with and without Eve, and check if Alice and Bob are able to detect Eve's presence.\n",

Therefore, instead of the instruction team providing a 'solution', we encourage you to post your implementations to Piazza to discuss with other students and instructors! We're excited to read what you come up with :)"
